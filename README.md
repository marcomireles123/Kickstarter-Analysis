# Kickstarter challenge

## Overview of Project
    -This analysis was created to determine the course of action to create a fundraiser for a theatre play.

### Purpose
    -The purpose of this assignment was to find the best time of the year and how much money to pledge for the creation of a theatre play, using information from previous simiar fundraisers around the world. 
    -They are also further broken down by categories and sub-categories in case there are specific ranges that the coordinator would like to see. 

## Analysis and Challenges
    -After consideration from the comparisons, it is determined that Louise should probably attempt to get play produced for ~4,000 GBP to ensure great success. 
    -If she asks for too much, backers may be disinterested and not donate.
    -If she asks for too little, the production would be too low cost and the play may suffer from a lack of funding. 
   
    -Some of the challenges I encountered while programing some of the sheets was becoming familiar with the formulas. COUNTIFS when working with one filter (less than 'X') was fairly simple since the parameters did not ask for much. 
    -As for the remainder of the parameters that did ask for a range between numbers (1000-4999) is when inputting the formula became more challenging. 
    -After asking for help from the TA's I started to realize that I was over thinking the problem and instead I have to think about it logically and efficiently, then it all started to click.
    -Some other formulas 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    -![graph](C:\Users\Marco\Desktop\Class Folder\resources\Outcomes_based_on_launch_date.png)
    -From the line graph we can determine that a majority of success occured in the middle of the year, in the summer. 
    -While there was more failures in the last and first months of the year around the winter season. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    -[graph](C:\Users\Marco\Desktop\Class Folder\resources\Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
    -From this graph we can determine that there is a point where failed and successful plays intersect.
    -This is the point where having the goal be too little or too much results in increased failures and less successful plays overall. 
    -We determined that if Louise asks for around 4,000 in GBP, she will have a higher amount of success in getting her play produced. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    -As mentioned before a majority of my challenges came from overthinking how the formulas were supposed to work.
    -With practice and manipulating the formulas after working with them, helped me understand them better. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    -Based on the time of year I could determine that there were more successful plays in May or the beginning of summer and they started to trail off immediately after.
    -As for plays that failed, they seem to have greater failures in the middle of the summer, accurately following the trend. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    -From the graph I can determine that some plays failed because they may have asked too much and were not able to meet their goal in the end. 
    -Same goes for plays that were successful.
        -There were a few number that were able to have better success if they asked for less money
        -The more money the successful plays asked for, the fewer goals were met. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    -I feel this dataset did not take into account personal reviews of the play. 
    -Was it any good? 
    -What were their final reviews on a number system? 
    -This could have an impact in determine if having more money for a play means it was any better than a lower production cost. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    -We could create a pie chart to visually see the number of plays that succeed based on how much their goals where.
    -This could give us a quick visual at the majority of plays that succeeded and draw an average that way.
